// Andrew Gold - Spooky Scary Skeletons

/**
 * Spooky, scary skeletons
 * Send shivers down your spine
 * Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
 * Seal your doom tonight
 * Spooky, scary skeletons
 * Speak with such a screech
 * You'll shake and shudder in surprise
 * When you hear these zombies shriek
 * We're sorry skeletons, you're so misunderstood
 * You only want to socialize, but I don't think we should
